WebGPU implementation of Boids algorithm

## TODO

- [x] Render each "boid" as a triangle
- [x] Rotate boid triangles to face the direction they are moving
- [x] Apply velocity to boids on every frame
- [x] Have walls at -1, 1 that reflect boids
- [ ] Apply separation
- [ ] Apply alignment
- [ ] Apply cohesion
- [ ] Support arbitrary boid meshes
- [ ] Render walls?
- [ ] Add the 3rd dimension
